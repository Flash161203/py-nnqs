# PyNNQS

This Python library, implemented in PyTorch, provides a framework for representing and optimizing Neural Network Quantum States (NNQS) using machine learning techniques. It supports both Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for modeling real and complex-valued wavefunctions.

This implementation is largely inspired by the [Mapalus](https://github.com/remmyzen/mapalus) library.

## Features

- RBM and MLP architectures for quantum state representation

- Support for real and complex wavefunctions

- Tools to compute ground states and excited states of quantum Hamiltonians

- Modular and extensible design for research and experimentation

## Applications

- Variational ground state search

- Learning excited states using orthogonalization techniques

- Benchmarking quantum systems like the Ising model
